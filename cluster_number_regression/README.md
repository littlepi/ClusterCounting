# Cluster Number Regression

Regression model for cluster number determination.

## Pre-processing
Preprocessing and convert the ROOT file to the text file. The input should be the output file from the peak finding algorithm (generated by post_processing.py).

Run:
```
root -q -l preprocessing.C"(\"../peak_classification/peak_finding.root\", \"dataset_train.txt\")"
```

## Train
Run the notebook train.ipynb

## Test
Run the notebook test.ipynb

## Others
Besides the jupyter notebook files, there are also equivalent python version files. And also scripts that wraps all processes together.
